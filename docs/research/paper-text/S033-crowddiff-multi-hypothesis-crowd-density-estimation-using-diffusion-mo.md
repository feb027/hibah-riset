Abstract
Crowd counting is a fundamental problem in crowd anal-
ysis which is typically accomplished by estimating a crowd
density map and summing over the density values. How-
ever, this approach suffers from background noise accumu-
lation and loss of density due to the use of broad Gaus-
sian kernels to create the ground truth density maps. This
issue can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian ker-
nel. However, existing approaches perform poorly when
trained with ground truth density maps with broad ker-
nels. To deal with this limitation, we propose using condi-
tional diffusion models to predict density maps, as diffusion
models show high fidelity to training data during genera-
tion. With that, we present CrowdDiff that generates the
crowd density map as a reverse diffusion process. Further-
more, as the intermediate time steps of the diffusion pro-
cess are noisy, we incorporate a regression branch for di-
rect crowd estimation only during training to improve the
feature learning. In addition, owing to the stochastic na-
ture of the diffusion model, we introduce producing multi-
ple density maps to improve the counting performance con-
trary to the existing crowd counting pipelines.
We con-
duct extensive experiments on publicly available datasets
to validate the effectiveness of our method. CrowdDiff out-
performs existing state-of-the-art crowd counting methods
on several public crowd analysis benchmarks with signif-
icant improvements.

1. Introduction
Crowd counting has been a fundamental problem in surveil-
lance, public safety, and crowd control. Various methods
have been proposed in the literature, including methods that
directly predict the count [22, 53, 60] or use a surrogate task
such as density estimation [14, 17, 47, 49, 51, 52], object
detection [31, 40], or point localization [10, 23, 46, 58].
While density-based methods sum the estimated pixel
density values for counting [14], localization-based meth-
ods count proposals with confidence scores higher than a
threshold [46]. As a result, density-based methods are more
susceptible to introducing background noise into the final

count compared to localization-based methods [50]. Fur-
thermore, density estimation methods are affected by vari-
ations in crowd density distributions that arise due to dif-
ferent congestion levels of the crowd [4]. This could re-
sult in a loss of accuracy in the density estimation. In con-
trast, recent localization-based methods with point queries
do not have the issue of background noise accumulation
[23], like in density-based methods [42], as there is no in-
terference between neighboring point proposals. However,
localization-based methods require crowd density heuristics
for proposal setting [46], which is not required by density-
based methods. Thus, if the premise of point supervision is
translated into density-based methods, it is possible to cir-
cumvent the requirement for crowd density heuristics, and
the flaws of conventional density-based methods, and a nar-
row density kernel can be used to achieve this. However,
Xu et al. [58] demonstrated that using a narrow kernel with
density regression methods is ineffective.
Alternatively, it is feasible to use a generative model
to predict the density map of a given crowd image that

would learn the distribution of the values in the density
map.
Though Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
based architectures have been used for density map predic-
tion [9, 41, 59], these methods still rely upon broad kernel
sizes and overlook the benefits of point supervision. Since
the model learns the distribution of the density pixel values,
it is advantageous to maintain the sample space of the den-
sity pixel values, and employing a broad kernel will only
discourage it. Furthermore, the use of both point super-
vision and crowd density prediction with generative mod-
els has not been thoroughly investigated before. Also, the
aforementioned GAN-based approaches restrict to a sin-
gle crowd density map realization similar to the regression-
based methods and jettison the stochastic nature of gener-
ative models to produce multiple density map realizations,
which could improve the counting performance.
We propose using denoising diffusion probabilistic mod-
els (diffusion models), [13, 37] to generate crowd density
maps for a given image. Though diffusion models have
been applied to segmentation [3, 11], super-resolution [19],
object detection [5], etc., to the best of our knowledge, nei-
ther crowd counting nor density map generation has been
studied with diffusion models. Furthermore, with the nar-
row kernel, we minimize the interference between adjacent
densities, which helps to maintain the bounds and the distri-
bution of density pixel values. This, in turn, simplifies the
distribution learning for the diffusion model and improves
density prediction as illustrated in Fig. 1, where the pro-
posed method has reproduced the narrow kernel even in a
dense region, while the other two recent methods failed.
Additionally, to eschew the probable loss of density with
the density-based crowd counting methods, we count the
number of blobs observed in the predicted density map by
thresholding pixel density values. Consequently, we elim-
inate the effect of background noise as there is no require-
ment to sum over the density pixel values. Then, we intro-
duce the crowd map fusion mechanism, combining multi-
ple dot maps constructed after thresholding to improve the
counting performance. This is only possible with generative
models due to their stochastic nature. In addition, inspired
by [8] on joint learning with diffusion models, we introduce
an auxiliary regression branch only during training, which
estimates the count based on encoder-decoder features from
the denoising network to improve feature learning.
In summary, our contributions are:
• We formulate crowd density map generation as a de-
noising diffusion process. CrowdDiff is the first study to
perform crowd counting with diffusion models.
• We promote using a narrow Gaussian kernel to ease
the learning process and facilitate the high-quality density
map generation with more fidelity to the ground truth.
• We propose a mechanism to consolidate multiple
crowd density realizations to improve performance uti-
lizing the stochastic nature of diffusion models.
• We show that the proposed method surpasses the
state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.
2. Background and Related Work
2.1. Crowd counting
Localization-based methods perform counting by predict-
ing the locations of heads, and generally, they involve pre-
dicting a bounding box [21, 31, 40, 62] for each head.
The literature has also proposed localization by points [21]
or blobs [29]. Recently, to remove the necessity of post-
processing, such as non-maximum suppression, point local-
ization [23, 46] was introduced to crowd counting.
Density-based methods [4, 20, 27, 28, 30, 36, 57] attempt
to produce a density map for a given crowd image. How-
ever, density-based methods suffer from background noise
and loss of density [32, 34, 38] in congested regions due
to broad kernels. But, using a narrow Gaussian kernel to
generate ground truths is ineffective according to [58] with
regression networks. Hence, we treat the prediction of the
density map as a generative task.
2.2. Diffusion models for crowd density generation
Diffusion models [44] are defined based on a Markov chain
with a forward and a reverse process. In the forward pro-
cess, noise is gradually added to data; and is denoised in the
reverse process. The forward process is formulated as,
 q(\mathbf  {x_t}
|
\ m athbf { x_{t-1}}) = \mathcal {N}(\mathbf {x_t}|\sqrt {1-\beta _t}\mathbf {x_{t-1}},\beta _t\mathbf {I}),
where the sample datum x0 is gradually transformed to a
noisy sample xt for t ∈{1, . . . , T} by adding Gaussian
noise according to a noise variance schedule β1, . . . , βT .
Here, I is the identity matrix. Nonetheless, xt can be com-
puted using x0 and a noise vector ϵ ∼N(0, I) and with the
forward transformation,
 \ m a thbf {
x
_t }  = \sqrt {\bar {\alpha _t}}\mathbf {x_0} + \sqrt {\left (1-\bar {\alpha _t} \right )}\epsilon ,
where ¯αt := Qt
τ=1 ατ = Qt
τ=1(1 −βτ) and βτ.
In this work, we aim to perform crowd density map gen-
eration via the diffusion model. Hence, our data samples
will be crowd density maps x0 ∈RH×W , where H and W
are the height and width dimensions. However, in lieu of
training a neural network to predict x0 from xt for various
time steps, we predict the amount of noise (ˆϵ) in xt at each
time step conditioned on the crowd image (y) and apply the
reverse diffusion process to obtain x0 ultimately.
To that end, to train the denoising diffusion network, we
use the hybrid loss (Lhybrid) function proposed in [37]. To
promote learning coarse features at lower SNR stages, we
adopt the weighting scheme [7] defined as,
  \
la b el {e q u
ation:
 l a mbda} \l a mbda _t = \ f
rac
 { \sfrac {(1-\beta _t)(1-\bar {\alpha _t})}{\beta _t}}{{\left (k + \text {\snr }{\scriptstyle (t)}\right )}^\gamma }, \text {where}\;\; \text {\snr }{\scriptstyle (t)} = \frac {\bar {\alpha _t}}{1-\bar {\alpha _t}} 
(1)
with k and γ as hyperparameters. Hence, the final loss over
which the denoising network is optimized is as follows,
 \mathc a l {L}_{hybrid} = \mathbf {E}_{\mathbf {x_0},\mathbf {y},\epsilon } \left [ \lambda _t{\lVert \hat {\epsilon }_{(\mathbf {x_0},\mathbf {y},t)} - \epsilon \rVert }_2^2\right ] + \lambda _{vlb}~\mathcal {L}_{vlb},

noising U-Net and discarded during inference.
where Lvlb is the original variational lower bound defined
in [37] and λvlb is its weighting factor.
3. CrowdDiff
In this section, we first review the motivation for selecting
an appropriate kernel size. We present the joint learning of
counting as an auxiliary task to improve the density map
generation performance. Finally, we introduce a method to
combine different realizations for density maps to improve
crowd counting performance. The overall crowd counting
pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 2.
3.1. Narrow kernel
The diffusion process requires a density map to learn the
conditional distribution of crowd density. The crowd den-
sity map can be acquired by convolving point information
with a pre-defined Gaussian kernel. For that, selecting a
proper kernel size and variance is important as it governs the
distribution of the pixel values of the crowd density maps.
As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the divergence between the
distribution of the Gaussian kernel (values) and the result-
ing density map increases as the kernel size and variance
increase, especially for the congested scene. This might
not be the case for sparse crowd scenes, as there is mini-
mal or no interference between density kernels. However,
this implies that the density pixel value distribution is highly
image-dependent, hindering the crowd densities’ learning.
This can be eschewed by narrowing the distribution of the
Gaussian kernel as illustrated in Fig. 3. This also helps the
(a) Narrow kernel (size:3×3, σ:0.5)
(b) Broad kernel (size:9×9, σ:1.0)

stems) and the resulting density map (blue stems) for a crowd im-

crease from left to right.
denoising network to maintain the pixel values within a pre-
defined range. The difference between the probability mass
of a broad Gaussian kernel and the resulting density map is
significant. This can lead to the clipping of many pixel val-
ues, resulting in a loss of information in congested scenes.
The aforementioned issue can be solved by a narrow ker-
nel. A narrow kernel provides an alternative path to crowd
counting without summing over the density map values. As
shown in Fig. 1, the crowd count can be obtained by sim-
ply counting the observable kernels. For that, we perform
thresholding on the density maps and obtain the location of
each kernel. Then, the crowd count is computed as the to-
tal number of locations. This provides the means to avoid
background noise in the generated density maps and to ob-
tain the crowd count by detecting these narrow kernels in
the crowd density maps. Unlike the local maxima detec-
tion strategy proposed in [24] to detect head locations from
a crowd density map, our method is not dependent on any
hyperparameter tuning for detection.
3.2. Joint learning of counting
Directly regressing the crowd count from image features
is a difficult task [22] compared to counting with a surro-
gate task. To perform the direct computation of the crowd
count, we consider the intermediate features of the encoder-
decoder of the denoising U-Net. Let’s denote the set of in-
termediate features from the denoising network for a partic-
ular timestep t as Zt = {z1
t, z2
t, . . . , zd
t }, where z∗
t is the
representation vector at the corresponding feature level of
the decoder. Since the spatial dimensions of the intermedi-
ate representations at different depth levels are incompati-
ble, global average pooling is performed on each z∗
t , which
are then concatenated to construct a single feature vector
zt. This is then passed through the regression network to
estimate the crowd count at various noise levels.
However, for a sampled pair (x0, y), only the density
map x0 is diffused with noise according to a noise schedule.
Hence, the noise level in the set of intermediate features
Zt will vary with the timestep, and SNR will be lower in
the later stages of the diffusion process than in the earlier
stages. Hence, we utilize the weighting scheme discussed in
3

puted from the neighbors (black) inside the neighbor radius. New
points (colored) that fall inside the rejection radius are removed
(red), and the rest (green) are combined into the compound map.
Sec. 2.2 during the training of the count regression network.
We utilize L1 loss as follows,
 \mathcal {L}_1^t = \lambda _t{\lVert \bar {c_t} - c\rVert }_
1
to measure the difference between the prediction (¯ct) and
the ground truth (c) for a given time step t and a given sam-
pled pair, where λt is the same weighting factor used in
Eq. (1). As the training loss for the denoising model is the
Monte-Carlo approximation of the sum over all timesteps,
the training loss can be written as
 \math c al {L}_ {count}  = \mathbb {E}_{\mathbf {x_0}, \mathbf {y}, t}\left [ \lambda _t{\lVert \bar {c_t} - c\rVert }_1 \right ] .
The overall training includes optimization over the param-
eters of the denoising network and the regression branch.
Hence, the overall training objective is as follows,
 \mathca l  {L}_{o v erall} = \mathcal {L}_{hybrid} + \lambda _{count}\mathcal {L}_{count},
where λcount is a weightage on the counting task.
3.3. Stochastic crowd map fusion
The stochastic nature of the diffusion models could gener-
ate different realizations of the crowd density map for the
same crowd image. Therefore, the counting performance
with diffusion models can be improved with multiple real-
izations contrary to the traditional crowd counting methods
as evidenced by other tasks based on diffusion models such
as segmentation [11] and detection [5]. However, rather
than averaging individual counts from different realizations,
they could be combined to compute a more improved count
because individual realizations could infer crowd densities
that were not present in other realizations.
To combine different realizations for the density maps,
only the new information should be transferred to the com-
pound density map. For that, we first compute the locations
of the density kernels by density thresholding. Once these
locations are found, a dot map is constructed for each den-
sity map, referred to as the ‘crowd map.’ Then, we consider
the dissimilarity between the crowd maps from different re-
alizations, and to measure that, we consider the structural
similarity index measure (SSIM) [55]. We assign a similar-
ity score measured as the cumulative SSIM with the remain-
ing crowd map realizations for each crowd map. Then, the
maps will be arranged in the ascending order of the SSIM
before combining.
Further, we don’t require the ground
truth locations to combine different realizations; they are
combined depending on the similarity of the crowd maps.
Let’s consider four crowd maps. For a given crowd map
(source map), we’ll measure the SSIM with each of the
remaining three crowd maps, and the sum of those three
SSIMs will be assigned as the similarity score of the source
map. If the similarity score is the highest of a map, then it
is the most similar to the remaining maps and likely to con-
tain most of the point locations available in the remaining
maps. Hence, the new points that can be added to and from
the most similar map are minimal. Conversely, the crowd
map with the least similarity score differs the most from the
remaining maps; therefore, the new points that can be added
to / from this map are maximal. Consequently, the best map
to start the fusion process is the crowd map with the lowest
similarity score. Likewise, we order the crowd maps in the
ascending order of the similarity score to combine.
When fusing two crowd maps, it is necessary to reject
repeating point locations. This is performed based on the
locations of the new points compared to the points in the
combined list. We take the crowd map first and the head
locations from that realization as the reference. Next, we
define a rejection radius for each head location as:
 r _ n
 = 
\be ta 
\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{\Tilde {k}}r_{ni}}{2\Tilde {k}}
by considering the k-nearest neighbors within a fixed range.
Here β is a scaling factor and ˜k is the total nearest neighbors
within the range. Next, we remove the head locations of
the next crowd map locations that fall within the rejection
radii in the reference map as illustrated in Fig. 4, and the
remaining locations are added to the reference map. This
procedure is performed until all realizations are exhausted.
4. Experimental Details
CrowdDiff pipelines.
During training, we create the
ground truth density map with narrow kernels as described
in Sec. 3.1. Next, we randomly sample a timestep t. Then,
we sample a Gaussian noise according to the variance at t
and add it to the ground truth map, resulting in the noisy
map (xt). Then, we input the image and xt to the denoising
U-Net (network) and predict the noise added to the ground
truth. Hence, based on the crowd image, the network is
trained to predict the noise in xt.
During inference, we
sample a Gaussian noise from N (0, I) at time T, which is
used as the initial noisy density map xT. Then, the network
will estimate the noise present in xT, and by removing that
noise, we produce the noisy density map (xT−1) at time
T −1. Likewise, we’ll repeat the process where the noisy
density map xt−1 at t −1 is estimated from the noisy den-
4

sity map xt at time t until we produce the density map (x0)
for the image. Besides that, the counting branch output is
discarded during inference.
Diffusion process uses 1,000 timesteps and DDIM sam-
pling [45] during inference. We use a linear noise schedule
with noise variance ranging from 1 × 10−3 to 0.02.
Hyperparameter values λcount is set as 5×10−3 to match
the range of the value for Lhybrid. The γ and k values are
set as 0.5 and 1, respectively, to compute the SNR-based
weighting factors. We adopt the original scaling factor of
1 × 10−3 for λvlb following [37]. For crowd map fusion,
we set β equal to 0.85 and the maximum nearest neighbors
to four. The radius for the neighbor search was restricted to
0.05 of the minimum of the image dimensions.
Training of the denoising network is initialized with the
ImageNet pre-trained weights for the super-resolution [39]
task except for the input and output layers. The network
is trained for 2 × 105 iterations with a batch size of 8 for
256 × 256 images. We use an AdamW optimizer with a
fixed learning rate 1 × 10−4 and a linear warm-up schedule
over 5 × 103 training steps following [56].
Evaluations are performed on six public datasets: JHU-
Crowd++[43], ShanghaiTech A[61], ShanghaiTech B[61],
UCF-CC-50[15], UCF-QNRF[16], and NWPU-Crowd[54].
We use MAE and MSE as the performance metrics.
5. Results
5.1. Crowd counting performance
Quantitative results for crowd counting are presented in
Tab. 1 for the proposed method with other existing meth-
ods. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art crowd
counting results on public crowd counting datasets, and two
factors can explain the improvement. First, the proposed
use of a narrow kernel has improved the counting results
in dense regions by mitigating the loss of density values in
contrast to conventional density-based methods. Second,
we eliminate the effect of background noise on the crowd
count, which scales with the image dimensions, by replac-
ing density summation with thresholding followed by sum-
mation. The performance on JHU-Crowd++, UCF-QNRF,
and NWPU-Crowd datasets explains the above effect of
CrowdDiff as these datasets contain dense crowd scenes
and large image dimensions. This was possible due to the
capability to produce accurate density maps with better re-
semblance to ground truth maps with diffusion models. In
Tab. 2, we provide the performance on the test set of the
NWPU-Crowd dataset.
In addition to the overall MAE,
CrowdDiff has the best performance in negative samples
or sparse crowds similar to detection or localization-based
methods. This is due to density thresholding because of the
ability to produce narrow kernels without intersections.
Qualitative results are presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 for
density map generation with diffusion models and crowd

map generation with the proposed pipeline. As depicted
in Fig. 1, the proposed method and the narrow kernel can
accurately perform counting even in a dense region.
In
contrast, the other two methods have suffered from loss of
density. Furthermore, our proposed pipeline has identified
head locations accurately, which is impossible with existing
density-based methods and without data heuristics, unlike
localization-based methods.
5.2. Ablation study
Diffusion models are considered to have more fidelity to
training data than GAN-based methods.
From Fig. 6,
one can see that diffusion models have produced high-
quality density maps with more accurate crowd counts
while ASCSP [41], a GAN-based method, has failed. Fur-
thermore, without the ability to produce narrow kernels in
the predicted density maps, GAN-based methods have to
use density summation as the counting operation, bringing
back noise accumulation and loss of density. This highlights
the importance of using diffusion models for crowd density
map generation with detection as the counting operation.
Stochastic crowd map generation is a key benefit of
diffusion-based generative models. In Fig. 7, we provide
qualitative results of two realizations for each crowd image.
From Fig. 7, we can see that different realizations have in-
formation that is not present in other realizations. Further-
more, it is noteworthy that using a narrow kernel facilitates
the ability to produce new knowledge that can be included
in the final prediction. Otherwise, novel information cap-
tured by different realizations will be diluted by averaging
the density maps had a larger kernel been used. Though this
is a generative model, the proposed method has reassigned
densities perfectly in certain instances, and for some cases,
there is a slight shift in the location between realizations.
This necessitates the need for the proposed crowd map fu-

sion method since simply combing these shifted dots results
in double counts and worsens the performance otherwise.
The counting branch is added to improve the counting per-
formance with the crowd density maps.
We present the
counting results for individual realizations with and with-
out the regression network in Tab. 3. We consider the aver-
age error performance from different realizations to identify
characteristic effects of the counting branch before com-
bining them into a single crowd map. Adding the count-
ing branch has improved the average counting results, and
the variation in the counting results has been reduced. The
counting branch also promotes feature learning for interme-
diate time steps with noisy features.
Furthermore, we considered the performance of the
counting branch even though it is not used to predict the
final count of CrowdDiff. The error metrics for the count-
ing branch are provided in Tab. 4 along with state-of-the-art
weakly-supervised crowd counting methods [18, 22]. The
counting branch can be considered as a subnetwork that was
weakly supervised with features from the denoising net-
work and in this regard, the counting branch of CrowdDiff
outperforms existing SOTA weakly-supervised methods.
Crowd map fusion leverages the stochastic nature of the
crowd density maps produced by the diffusion process, and
we adopt a systematic way to fuse the maps. In Tab. 5,
we present the error metrics for three different methods:
Random, Descend-SSIM, and Ascend-SSIM. In the Ran-
dom method, we combine the maps in the order in which
they are produced. In the Descend-SSIM method, we com-
bine the maps in the order of decreasing similarity. In the
Ascend-SSIM method, we combine the maps in the order
of increasing similarity as described above. The iterative
improvement with stochastic generation and the proposed
fusion method is shown in Fig. 8. From Tab. 5, the counting
performance has improved with the Ascend method, where
more locally dissimilar realizations are combined initially.
This observation is validated by the performance degra-
dation with the Descend-SSIM method compared to both
Ascend-SSIM and Random methods.
Additionally, the fusion of multiple realizations is prone
to introduce false positives. Hence, we considered the lo-
calization and counting performance after fusing different
realizations for UCF-QNRF. We generated four additional
realizations for this ablation study, and the corresponding
results are provided in Tab. 6 along with the respective in-
ference time. From Tab. 6, we see that the localization and
counting performance improves with multiple realizations,
demonstrating the advantage of using a generative model

and fusing the information from multiple realizations. How-
ever, a higher number of realizations increases the inference
time, and the performance gain from four realizations to
eight realizations is insignificant while the inference time
has doubled. Consequently, we chose to produce four real-
izations as the optimal setting considering the performance
and inference time trade-off.
Density thresholding is used as an alternative to density
summation for the counting operation. The performance
comparison between the two methods is tabulated in Tab. 8
for the best-performing realization of each dataset. From
Tab. 8, we see that the density summation produces inferior
counting results than thresholding despite both methods us-
ing the same density map. This is because background noise
accumulation with the summation operation and the thresh-
olding method display better noise immunity.
Kernel size of the density kernels used to generate the
ground truth density map x0 affects the generation ability
and performance of CrowdDiff.
We tabulate the perfor-
mance with different kernel sizes in Tab. 7. We observed
similar performance at 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 kernels, and the per-
formance significantly dropped for the latter kernel sizes.
This is because the kernel size affects the pixel value dis-
tribution of the density map, and the interference between
adjacent kernels introduces true positives at local maxima.
Figure 7. Qualitative results for stochastic crowd map generation
from two realizations. Green boxes include new dots created at
different realizations. Blue boxes include dots present in both re-
alizations but with a shift, and pink boxes include perfectly reas-
signed dots. (best viewed in highest zooming level)
Rejection radius (β) and nearest neighbors (k) influence
the performance of the fusion of multiple realizations. The
results for different β and k values are tabulated in Tab. 9.
The rejection criterion is stable around the β values from
0.80 to 0.85. Because a low β value is susceptible to includ-
ing false positives or duplicates, and a high β value could
also reject true positives. However, the performance dif-
ference for different k values was insignificant and the best
performing setting was selected.
The inference process of the diffusion-based models is it-
erative and, therefore, exacts higher inference times. How-
ever, since we threshold the density map to count the num-
ber of kernels rather than summing over the pixel density
values, the proposed method is robust to residual noise in
the background. With the above exception, we used DDIM
sampling to improve the inference procedure by a factor of
20 rather than using the original number of diffusion steps
without a significant performance drop.
More results and details can be found in the supplementary.
6. Conclusions
We proposed a novel crowd counting framework where den-
sity map generation was treated as a denoising diffusion
process. The new framework allows using extremely nar-
row density kernels with which noise can be suppressed
more robustly in crowd density maps. Consequently, we
performed density kernel detection on crowd density maps
which offered more immunity to noise than density summa-
tion. Also, the proposed method could iteratively improve
the counting performance via multiple realizations, unlike
other crowd counting frameworks, due to the stochastic
nature of the generative models. Further, unlike existing
density-based methods, our proposed method assigns den-

B. Experimental details
1. Denoising network architecture Denoising network has
a U-Net architecture [37], and each downsampling and up-
sampling layer scales the features by a factor of two along
each spatial dimension. We use average pooling for down-
sampling with a 2 × 2 kernel, a stride of 2, and nearest
neighbor interpolation for upsampling. The 2-dimensional
convolution layers are 3 × 3 kernels with a stride of 1, and
the 1-dimensional convolution layers have a kernel size and
a stride of 1. In the multi-head self-attention module, the
channel dimension of each head is kept constant at 64, and
the number of heads is varied according to the channel di-
mension of each depth level. The denoising network and
the basic modules are illustrated in Fig. B.1.
Regression branch is a lightweight network with linear
layers and a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) [2] activation.
We apply global average pooling to maintain compatibility
along the spatial dimension for channel-wise concatenation.
C. Evaluation metrics
To evaluate crowd counting performance, we use the mean
absolute error (MAE):
  M A E
 
=
 
\fr
ac { 1}{N}\sum _{n=1}^{N} {\lVert c_n - \bar {c_n} \rVert }_1, 
and root mean squared error (MSE):
  M S
E
 
=
 \
s
q
r
t {
\fr a c {1}
{N}\sum _{n=1}^{N} {\lVert c_n - \bar {c_n} \rVert }_2^2} 
as the performance metrics. Here, N is the total number
of test samples, cn is the ground truth count, and ¯cn is the
prediction for the nth sample.
D. Datasets
We evaluate our method on five public datasets: JHU-
Crowd++[43], ShanghaiTech A[61], ShanghaiTech B[61],
UCF-CC-50[15], and UCF-QNRF[16] for crowd counting.
JHU-Crowd++ [43] has 2,722 training images, 500 valida-
tion images, and 1,600 test images collected from diverse
scenarios. The dataset consists of crowd images with num-
bers ranging up to 25,791 and images without any crowd.
ShanghaiTech A [61] contains 300 training images and 182
test images with annotations. We randomly select 30 sam-
ples from the training dataset as the validation dataset.
ShanghaiTech B [61] contains 400 training images and 316
testing images with annotations.
We create a validation
dataset with randomly selected 40 crowd images from the
training dataset.
UCF-CC-50 [15] is a comparatively small crowd dataset

for extremely dense crowd counting with just 50 samples.
We perform a 5-fold cross-validation following the standard
protocol in [15].
UCF-QNRF [16] dataset contains 1,535 images of uncon-
strained crowd scenes, with approximately one million an-
notations in total. The dataset is split into a training set of
1,201 images and a testing set of 334 images.
NWPU-Crowd NWPU-Crowd [54] is a large-scale dataset
collected from various scenes, consisting of 5,109 images.
The images are randomly split into training, validation, and
test sets containing 3109, 500, and 1500 images, respec-
tively. This dataset provides box-level annotations.
E. Additional qualitative results
We provide a qualitative comparison between the feature
maps of the denoising U-Net with and without the counting
branch prediction for different time steps in Fig. E.1. From
Fig. E.1, we can see that the decoder features are richer in
detail for the case with the counting branch than without
it. With the counting branch, the decoder generates features
for the crowd starting from the initial time step. The per-
formance of the counting branch further clarifies this, as the
predicted count has not varied with time and deviated from
the ground truth count significantly.
F. Number of inference steps
Though the diffusion model was trained using 1,000 diffu-
sion steps, we can perform inference with fewer steps using
DDIM sampling [45]. However, selecting the number of
sampling steps with a good compromise between the infer-
ence speed and MAE performance is pertinent. We consid-
ered different sampling steps and the corresponding infer-
ence speed and performance to decide the number of infer-
ence steps. We then compared it with the inference speed
and performance of state-of-the-art methods to find an op-
timal number of sampling steps. We display the variation
between performance and inference speed in Fig. F.1 for
MAE and MSE with CrowdDiff. In Fig. F.1, the values
are provided for the average from four realizations on UCF-
QNRF benchmark, and the shaded region marks the interval
of the inference speed for the most recent crowd analysis
methods: PET [26], STEERER [12], and CrowdHat [56].
Besides that, recently published “consistency models” [48]
could improve the sampling quality of few-step inference
and facilitate single-step inference.
